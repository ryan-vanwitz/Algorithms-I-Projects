	 * First we need to identify how long it takes one skillet to fully cook.
	 * We know that the skillets need to cook on both sides for one minute,
	 * so their total cooking time equates to 2 minutes. Furthermore, with an
	 * aim of cooking 52 skillets, that means we have a total cooking time of
	 * 104 minutes. Knowing that we only have 10 minutes to cook, we can divide
	 * the total cooking time of the skillets into the avaliable cooking time.
	 * This produces a number of 10.4 which is the amount of skillets that the
	 * barbecue must hold. With that being said, we cannot cook 0.4 skillets at
	 * a time, so we must cook the skillets on a barbecue that can fit 11
	 * skillets if we want to finish within 10 minutes.
